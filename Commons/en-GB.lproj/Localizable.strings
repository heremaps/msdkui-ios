This means reduced development time and a faster time to market. So, for example, where you would normally need several days to build a maneuver list using our native APIs, with the new UI kit, you'll only a few hours. However, if needed, the UI Kit still allows you to modify the appearance (e.g. colors, dimensions) and behavior (e.g. data presentation, logic, flow, subcomponents) of some UI controls.";
